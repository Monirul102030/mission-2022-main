            <p>A mission statement is a short statement of why an organization exists, what its overall goal is,
                identifying the goal of its operations: what kind of product or service it provides, its primary
                customers or market, and its geographical region of operation. It may include a short statement of such
                fundamental matters as the organization's values or philosophies, a business's main competitive advantag

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>An aimless person is like a ship that has lost its control over the sea. The Aim is defined as a
                    strong will to achieve something. Every person must have a well-defined objective in life. It helps
                    a person to understand the direction of his/her career.</p>

                <h3>Vission</h3>
                <p>Every person has a set of goals in life that they want to reach. To achieve their goal, that person
                    needs to work hard, and aims/goals help a person attain his value in society</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>An aim is a goal or purpose in lifeâ€”a person when young dreams to become an astronaut, or dancer, or
                    an actor. Aim helps you try, or aspire to achieve it. The primary step to achieving your goals is
                    setting the right purpose; then, break your goal into small sections and prepare a timeline to make
                    them. </p>
